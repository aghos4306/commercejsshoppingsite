## Install dependencies @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @chec/commerce.js @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js react-router-dom react-hook-form

## Delete src folder and re-create it from scratch starting with index.js and App.css...

## Products Component: creata a funtion based component for products, create arbitratry products as an array of object. Within the Products function, run map function on the products created. For each product we return properties specific for that product. This Product is the singular product component.

## Single Product component. This component is going to have all specific layout for each product e.g image, description, title etc. import from material ui Card, CardMedia, CardContent, CardAction, Typography, IconBotton. import { AddShoppingCart } from '@material-ui/icons'. The Product is a material ui card component. The title which is product.name comes from Products since Product is a child component to Products. Since Product is rendered in Products, we can pass props into Product component that is rendered in Products.js file. The prop is product, which is the entire product we are looping over. Inside of Product.jsx we have access to product.name, product.id, product.description, product.price once they are destructure in Product.jsx component. An alternative to pass them as props, props, then inside Typography we will instead have props.product.price, props.product.name etc.

# Create styles.js file inside Product folder. This style is used have all the classes used to style single Product. Create the style, and apply them in Product.jsx component. Now go to App.js component and import Products component here, and render Products within the div.

## Navigation bar.Create a Navbar component. Import AppBar, Toolbar, IconButton, Badge, MenuItem, Menu, Typography from material-ui/core. Create Navbar layout.

## Navbar image. create assets folder inside src. paste image inside assets folder. import this image as logo into Navbar.jsx and just use the logo. Build the navbar, import it into App.js file and render it.

# Create styles.js file for Products. Style Products cos navbar overlaps with products.

## Fetch Products from commerce js store. Create in components lib -> commerce.js. import Commerce from @chec/commerce.js. Create a new instance of Commerce. Create an account on commercejs.com to get public and private key. create .env file on the root where you will store public key from commerce. Pass this public key into Commerce by using process.env.NAME, pass in a second argument of true. We just created a commerce store. This commerce object can be used all over the application. Usually creating a full fledge ecommerce store, you need a backend api for creating products, fetching products, deleting, updating, authentication and a lot more. All of these is stored in this commerce instance we just created.

## Import commerce into App.js. Still in App.js use the useState hook to fetch products, by default the products is an empty array. use the useEffect hook to populate the products immediately the application loads. The function we create now fetchProducts will asynchronously get all products. Destructure the data from the products. The data is going to be the products. Once the products is set into setProducts, we now call the created fetchProducts function inside the useEffect hook. The empty array means that the fetchProducts function is only going to run at the start of the render. In class based component, this is called componentDidMount. Recap, the fetchProducts function called inside the useEffect hook will call our commerce products list and set the products to the state. console.log(products) gives first an empty array and then undefined. If you go to commerce.js dashboard and go to Products, you will see that Products array is completely empty. You can add products straight from the dashboard. Lets add couple products. sku field should be left empty for commerce js to automatically generate products id. Specify the products e.g keyboard in commerce dashboard. Upon refreshing, you notice the console now have one product. Add more products through commerce js dashboard. As you can see now on the console, the array is now filled with 8 objects.

## Instead of having mockup products, to display these products from commerce, we have to pass them as props to our Products component rendered inside App.js file. Now go to Products.jsx components, destructure products here also. We can comment out now the test products array. We now have the access to the real products. For each product, we send specific product object inside Product component. Most of the work now is going to be done inside the Product.jsx component.

# Product component. Check what property product object have.To test console.log(product) and return <div>Product Sample</div> just so that we dont return the actual return which might give error at this state of development. We can see each product object on the console. Now which properties do we need from each one of these object? product.image will be product.media.source, product.name stays same, product.price will be product.price.formatted_with_symbol
